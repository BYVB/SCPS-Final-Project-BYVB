        <h2>The Region</h2>
        <p> For 15 years, Glynwood has been helping communities develop wisely
and sustainably. Several years ago, recognizing that the primary concern
of most communities was the loss of local farms, we began to focus on
ensuring that farmers in the region would remain in business.
We have sought to protect and enhance farming in the region by
marshalling good information that shows the positive impacts of farming,
and by gathering data that illustrates the trends, challenges, and
opportunities for farmers in the Hudson Valley. However, most often, we
are confronted by a scarcity of such data on agriculture at the regional level.</p>
